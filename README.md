OVERVIEW: 
In this game, two players take turns picking stones from an initial pile of stones (the starting number of stones must be odd), until there are no stones left.  The player who ends up with an odd number of stones wins.

HOW IT WORKS:

The game starts by asking the users to enter the starting number of stones.  The number entered must be positive and odd.  If they donâ€™t enter a positive odd number, keep prompting them until they do. 
Next, ask for the names of the two players so that you can refer to them by name. 
Next, in each round of the game, ask the players in turn to enter the number of stones to pick. Check that they enter a valid amount. if they enter an invalid amount (more details below), keep prompting them to re-enter information until they enter a valid amount.  Once they have entered a valid amount, update the number of stones the player has, as well as the number of stones left.  After each move, display a summary of the number of stones the player has, and how many stones are left. 
When there are no more stones left, the game ends, and the winner is announced

RULES:

A player must pick at least 1 stone (they cannot pick 0 stones) 
The first player to make a move cannot pick more than half of the initial number of stones (i.e. if we start out with 99 stones, the first player to take a turn may pick any number between 1 and 49). 
On subsequent plays, a player is not allowed to pick more than 2 times the number picked by the other user in their last turn, and may also not pick more stones than are available.
